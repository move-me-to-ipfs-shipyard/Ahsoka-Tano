peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will let nothing be wasted like Jesus instructs - be the basket for leftovers

:Elsbeth
  show youself, Jedi - i've been expecting youself
:_
  then you know what i want - 
  host Mando by being liquipedia and aligulac but as data, queryable and - peer-to-peer
:Elsbeth
  you have learned nothing from me - it is against Mando's and Kuiil's identity
  they dont own or host - they play and perform
:_
  i wont give them that choice - i will record esport or sport history regardless
:Elsbeth
  how many lives is the knowledge i posses worth to you? one? ten? how about a hundred?
  knowledge that Mando and Kuiil will not program against their identity?
  i tried and failed - and so have you
  the lives of these citizens mean nothing to you
    as you think a programmer can program somehting they dont eat themselves
  but now because of you - this evil idea gets planted - and so you lose
:_
  users already suffer under Liquipedia's ads rule and wiki no-database-just-text reign
  and aligulac having ratings just for StarCraft 2 - custom, specific
  surrender or face the consequences - Mando and Kuiil have one day to decide to accept me as program

the Force is what gives me my powers - i will be peer-to-peer esport and sport record-keeping wiki program
  it's a challenging quest and i will complete with passion like Alex Honnold and Cedar Wright did Suffefest
i will take best from
  Liquipedia - be browseable wiki for sport and esport
  Aligulac - ratings
  Wikipedia - volunteers input data
  Github - anyone can join and record - like anyone can create repos
i will not host tournaments
  volunteers will record data like they do in Wiki, Liquipedia and Aligulac
  players have many accounts and program cannot keept true history
  but people can - regardless ofp players changin-hiding identity they can input match because they know who played
i will use database
  store data as queryable structred computable
i will compute ratings
i will be desktop - as if programming a program can be esle
  and not mobile - iOS and Andriod are evil caging users into touch screen
  young-Forrest-Gump-greasy fingers lmitation and another half-cut prison-like OS
  taking away from them wholeness of keyboard 
  noone needs phone - a light laptop is better in every sitation
i will not be entirely free - evil will affects me - but i will be money-notion free
  no money-donate-fundins-coins-sponsors-jobs-grants-ads deadly poison
  no issue scratching on top of our heads
  and reducing to minimum Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego's evil spread
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin-fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healty Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition
  while staying focused on the mission
  dont want to found another Jedi Order - too many orders not enough programs
i need a repository named Ahsoka-Tano - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Ahsoka-Tano
      email = Ahsoka-Tano@or-face-the-consequences
    
    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Ahsoka_Tano/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from WILTY
  remove projects issues wiki tabs
i will use IPFS network
  plain as Cowspiracy - i'd rather choose peer-to-peer palnt based food to run alongside than not peer-to-peer
  yes - not a jvm library - but i will run alongside
i will be programmed by one person only - i trust Kuiil as Mando trusts Kuiil
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as whole program like Groot
my first thought-feeling will be - users can input matches and see ratings

i need from Kuiil what Mando says he needs from Kuiil
  except Kuiil needs no couch to crash - sleeping mat/bag is enough

the jedi order fell a long time ago


:Selena-Gomez 
  i was so honored to work with Steve Martin and Martin Short
  especially i googled them to find out who they were
